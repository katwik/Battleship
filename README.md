    Developer Katarina Wikstr√∂m

This Battleships is a Python terminal game, that runs on Heroku in a mock terminal provided by Code Institute.
The user tries to find the battleships in 15 turns. Each ship occupies one square on the board.

## How to play
Battleships is based on the classic pen-and-paper game. 
In this version the computer creates a hidden board with five ships and one empty board the player sees. The user then tries to find the ships by guessing a row and a column. Guesses are marked on the board by - . Hits are marked with an X. The game is over when the user has made 15 guesses or found all the ships before the countdown.
